<h1>SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR MAXON CINEBENCH</h1>

<p>
This Software License Agreement (the "Agreement") is a legal agreement between you and MAXON Computer GmbH, Max-Planck-Straße 20, 61381 Friedrichsdorf, Germany ("MAXON"), 
governing the use of the benchmarking software MAXON CINEBENCH ("CINEBENCH").
<br />
By downloading or using CINEBENCH, you agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, you are not allowed to download or use CINEBENCH.
</p>

<h2>1 Subject Matter</h2>

<ol type="i">
	<li>CINEBENCH is a benchmarking software for the testing and benchmarking of computer hardware and system configurations when using MAXON CINEMA&nbsp;4D. CINEBENCH does not include the application MAXON CINEMA&nbsp;4D. MAXON provides CINEBENCH to you by courtesy and at no cost.</li>
	<li>The benchmarking results provided by CINEBENCH are indicative of overall system performance when using MAXON CINEMA&nbsp;4D and do not necessarily reflect the performance of the tested hardware in general and/or with other applications. Performance of each component (processor, graphics card) also depends on other system components and circumstances. The results provided by CINEBENCH are typical, although not derived from specific testing procedures. MAXON does not warrant that the results obtained from any use of CINEBENCH will be accurate and reliable and will not make any verification of the results. You are solely responsible for any use of CINEBENCH and for any use and interpretation of the benchmarking results.</li>
	<li>You may publish and make available the benchmarking results obtained by you from using CINEBENCH provided that you identify MAXON and the CINEBENCH version with the following notice: “Maxon Cinebench Release 20” You may not declare or imply that the benchmarking was performed, supported, verified or certified by MAXON.</li>
	<li>MAXON offers CINEBENCH to you “as is”. MAXON does not warrant that CINEBENCH operates without interruption or error, has specific functions, complies to specific requirements and is merchantable, free of defects in quality or title, compatible with specific software and hardware and suitable for a particular purpose.</li>
	<li>MAXON is under no obligation to provide technical maintenance and support to you, to rectify defects and to restore failed systems and lost data.
</ol>

<h2>2 Grant of License</h2>

<ol type="i">
	<li>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, MAXON hereby grants to you a personal, limited, non-exclusive right to install CINEBENCH on an unlimited number of computers and to use it in object code form on these computers solely for the purpose of testing and benchmarking the performance of computer hardware and system configurations when using MAXON CINEMA&nbsp;4D (the “License”).
	<li>You shall not make available, rent, transfer or sublicense CINEBENCH to any third party.
	<li>You may translate, adapt, rearrange or otherwise modify CINEBENCH only to the extent required for the use in accordance with this Agreement and for the correction of defects, provided that MAXON refused to make such modifications or to correct such defects against adequate compensation.
	<li>You may decompile CINEBENCH only to the extent permitted under Sec. 69e German Copyright Act and only if MAXON has not provided you within reasonable time upon your written request with data and/or information required to ensure the interoperability of CINEBENCH with other software.
	<li>Except as expressly provided hereinabove, MAXON does not grant any express or implied rights or licenses to you.
</ol>

<h2>3 Violation of Rights of Use</h2>

<ol type="i">
	<li>If MAXON’s rights of use are violated, MAXON has the right to terminate this EULA without liability, and with no effect on any claims for damages. In such a case, you must return all Software, including all accompanying materials. If back-up copies have been made or copies have been made based on a copying license, these copies must be destroyed and the Software installed on the hardware in question must be deleted. You must provide MAXON with proof of deletion and destruction in written form upon first request.
			The software contains technical functions for the protection of MAXON’s usage rights against unauthorized use. MAXON processes and collects this data in order to protect and enforce its rights of use. In particular, the software gathers data about the system and network on which the software is installed and used as well as about the dates and number of duplications, use and access. This data can be sent to MAXON via the software’s communication ports using network connections and the Internet. The end user agrees that MAXON processes and uses this data to protect and enforce their usage rights. The end user is not permitted to remove or circumvent these protective functions and is not permitted to use the software without these protective functions in place. Disabling the User Participation options will not disable this function.
			If the end user breaches this agreement or MAXON’s usage rights or MAXON reasonably determines they will do so, MAXON can prevent the further usage of the installation and installation of updates. MAXON reserves the right to file civil or criminal charges.</li>
</ol>

<h2>4 Liability</h2>

<ol type="i">
	<li>4.1	MAXON shall be liable without limitations (1) in case of intent and gross negligence; (2) in case of injuries to life, body or health; (3) pursuant to the terms of the German Product Liability Act; and (4) under a guarantee granted by MAXON.
	<li>4.2	Subject to Sec. 4.1 above, MAXON’s liability for slightly negligent breaches of cardinal duties shall be limited to such damage which was typical for this kind of business and foreseeable upon the execution of this Agreement. Cardinal duties are duties of MAXON which enable the performance of this Agreement, i. e. are precondition of the performance of this Agreement, and which you may therefore rely on.
	<li>4.3	MAXON shall not be liable irrespective of the legal grounds except as expressly set forth in Sec. 4.1 to 4.2 above.
</ol>

<h2>5 Termination</h2>

<ol type="i">

	<li>5.2	Any termination or expiration of this Agreement shall terminate the License with immediate effect and you shall immediately delete and destroy all copies and stop any use of CINEBENCH.
</ol>

<h2>6 General Provisions</h2>
