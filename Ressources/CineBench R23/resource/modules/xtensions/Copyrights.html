<br>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:
<br>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
<br>Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and
<br>(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.
</p><p>2.2. Effective Date
<br>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.
</p><p>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
<br>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
<br>Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:
<br>(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
<br>or
<br>(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or
<br>(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.
<br>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
</p><p>2.4. Subsequent Licenses
<br>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
</p><p>2.5. Representation
<br>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
</p><p>2.6. Fair Use
<br>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
</p><p>2.7. Conditions
<br>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.
</p><p>3. Responsibilities
<br>---------------------------------------------------------
</p><p>3.1. Distribution of Source Form
<br>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.
</p><p>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
<br>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
<br>(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
<br>(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
</p><p>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
<br>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).
</p><p>3.4. Notices
<br>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
<br>(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
</p><p>3.5. Application of Additional Terms
<br>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.
</p><p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
<br>---------------------------------------------------------
<br>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
<br>describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
</p><p>5. Termination
<br>---------------------------------------------------------
</p><p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
</p><p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
</p><p>2.1 of this License shall terminate.
</p><p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.

<br>* *
<br>* 6. Disclaimer of Warranty *
<br>* ------------------------- *
<br>* *
<br>* Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" *
<br>* basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or *
<br>* statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the *
<br>* Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a *
<br>* particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the *
<br>* quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. *
<br>* Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You *
<br>* (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, *
<br>* repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an *
<br>* essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is *
<br>* authorized under this License except under this disclaimer. *
<br>* *
<br>************************************************************************
<br>************************************************************************
<br>* *
<br>* 7. Limitation of Liability *
<br>* -------------------------- *
<br>* *
<br>* Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort *
<br>* (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any *
<br>* Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as *
<br>* permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, *
<br>* special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character *
<br>* including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of *
<br>* goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any *
<br>* and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party *
<br>* shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This *
<br>* limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or *
<br>* personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the *
<br>* extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some *
<br>* jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of *
<br>* incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and *
<br>* limitation may not apply to You. *
<br>* *
<br>************************************************************************
</p><p>8. Litigation
<br>---------------------------------------------------------
<br>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
<br>Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
</p><p>9. Miscellaneous
<br>---------------------------------------------------------
<br>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
</p><p>10. Versions of the License
<br>---------------------------------------------------------
</p><p>10.1. New Versions
<br>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
</p><p>10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
</p><p>10.2. Effect of New Versions
<br>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.
</p><p>10.3. Modified Versions
<br>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).
</p><p>10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
<br>If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
<br>Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

<p>Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG software 
<br>-------------------------------------------
</p><p>This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding, and transcoding. JPEG is a standardized compression method for full-color and grayscale images.
</p><p>The distributed programs provide conversion between JPEG JFIF format and image files in PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, GIF, BMP, and Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression library can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers. The package is highly portable C code; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.
</p><p>We are releasing this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.

<p> <span class="HL_2">SketchUp</span></p>
<p>Thank you for using Trimble's SketchUp APIs. These APIs are provided by Trimble Navigation Limited (referred to as Trimble, we, our, or us in these terms), located at 935 Stewart Drive, Sunnyvale, California 94085, United States. These terms outline your rights and responsibilities when using our APIs, so read them carefully. Additional terms may apply to the use of an API, including additional terms of service, terms within the accompanying API documentation, and any applicable policies or guidelines. If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms apply for that conflict. If you use the APIs as an interface to, or in conjunction with other Trimble products and services, then the terms for such products and services also apply.</p>
<p>Section 1: Account and Registration Accepting the Terms. You may not use the APIs and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Trimble, or (b) you are a person barred from using or receiving the APIs under the applicable laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the APIs. Google Account. You may need to create a Google account in order to use an API or a Google account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you are using a Google account assigned to you by an administrator, your legal relationship with your administrator may affect that account. It's your responsibility to keep your password, account credentials, and accounts secure. If you learn of any unauthorized use of your account, follow the instructions at <a href="http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?answer=58585">http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?answer=58585</a>. Registration. In order to access certain APIs you may be required to provide certain information (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the APIs, or as part of your continued use of the APIs. You agree that any registration information you give to Trimble will always be accurate and up to date. Subsidiaries and Affiliates. Trimble has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world. You agree that these companies may provide the APIs to you on behalf of Trimble and these terms will also govern your relationship with these companies.</p>
<p>Section 2: Using Our APIs Your End Users. You will require your end users to comply with any applicable law and these terms. You will not knowingly enable your end users to violate applicable law or these terms. Compliance with Law. You will use our APIs only as permitted by law (including without limitation laws regarding the import or export of data or software, privacy, or local laws). You will not use the APIs to encourage or promote illegal activity. Permitted Access. You will only access (or attempt to access) an API by the means described in the documentation of that API. If Trimble assigns you developer credentials or Client IDs, you must use them with the applicable APIs. You will not misrepresent or mask either your identity or your API Client's identity when using the APIs or developer accounts. API Limitations. Trimble may set limits on the number of API requests that you can make, at its sole discretion. You agree to such limitations and will not attempt to circumvent such limitations. Open Source Software. Some of the software required by or included in our APIs may be offered under an open source license. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms, and in those cases, the overriding provisions apply. Monitoring. Trimble may monitor the use of the APIs to ensure quality, improve Trimble products and services, and verify your compliance with these terms. You will not interfere with such monitoring. Trimble may use any technical means to overcome such interference. Communication with Trimble. You agree that we may send you certain communications in connection with your use of the APIs. Please review the applicable API documentation for information about opting out of certain types of communication. Feedback. If you provide feedback or suggestions about our APIs, then we may use such information without obligation to you. </p>
<p>Section 3: Your API Clients API Clients. The APIs are designed to help you enhance your websites and applications (API Client(s)). Trimble reserves the right to investigate any API Client for compliance with these terms. Such investigations may include Trimble accessing and using your API Client, for example to identify security issues that could affect Trimble or its users. You consent to any such investigation. Trimble may suspend access to our APIs by you or your API Client without notice if we reasonably believe that you are in violation of these terms. Security. You will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user information collected by your API Client, including personally identifiable information (PII), from unauthorized access or use and will promptly report to your users any unauthorized access or use of such information. Ownership. Trimble does not acquire ownership in your API Clients, and by using our APIs, you do not acquire ownership of any rights in our APIs or the content that is accessed through our APIs. User Privacy and API Clients. You will comply with all privacy laws and regulations including those applying to PII. You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your API Client that clearly and accurately describes to users of your API Client what user information you collect (such as PII, login information and, if applicable, Trimble or Google account data) and how you use and share such information (including for advertising) with Trimble and third parties. If your privacy policy is used to comply with the EU Data Protection Directive, then it must adhere to the US Safe Harbor principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, and Access at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018475.asp">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018475.asp</a>. </p>
<p>Section 4: Prohibitions API Prohibitions. When using the APIs, the following prohibitions apply: 1. You will not sublicense an API for use by a third party. Consequently, you will not create an API Client that functions substantially the same as the APIs and offer it for use by third parties. 2.

<p>Section 5: Content Content Accessible Through our APIs. Our APIs contain some third party content (such as text, images, videos, audio, or software). This content is the sole responsibility of the person that makes it available. We may sometimes review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content. Finally, content accessible through our APIs may be subject to intellectual property rights, and, if so, you may not use it unless you are licensed to do so by the owner of that content or are otherwise permitted by law. Your access to the content provided by the API may be restricted, limited, or filtered in accordance with local laws, regulations, and policies. Submission of Content. Some of our APIs allow the submission of content, and except as expressly provided in these terms, Trimble does not acquire any ownership of any intellectual property rights that you or your end users hold in the content that you submit to our APIs through your API Client. By submitting, posting or displaying content to or from the APIs through your API Client, you give Trimble a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. However, Trimble will only use such content for the purpose of enabling Trimble to provide the APIs and only in accordance with the applicable Trimble privacy policies. You agree that this license includes a right for Trimble to make such content available to other companies, organizations or individuals with whom Trimble has relationships for the provision of services, and to use such content in connection with the provision of those services. Before you submit content to our APIs through your API Client, ensure that you have the necessary rights (including the necessary rights from your end users) to grant us the license. Retrieval of content. When a user's non-public content is obtained through the APIs, you may not expose that content to other users or to third parties without explicit opt-in consent from that user. Data Portability. Trimble supports data portability. By accessing users' data through the APIs for use in any of your services or applications, you agree to enable your users of any such service or application to export their equivalent data to other services or applications of their choice in a way that's substantially as fast and easy as exporting such data from Trimble products and services, subject to applicable laws. Prohibitions on Content. Unless expressly permitted by the content owner or by applicable law, you agree that you will not, and will not permit your end users to, do the following with content returned from the APIs: <p>1. Scrape, build databases or otherwise create permanent copies of such content, or keep cached copies longer than permitted by the cache header;</p><p>2. Copy, translate, modify, create a derivative work of, sell, lease, lend, convey, distribute, publicly display or sublicense to any third party;</p><p>3. Misrepresent the source or ownership; or</p><p> 4. Remove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices, falsify or delete any author attributions, legal notices or other labels of the origin or source of material.</p>
<p>Section 6: Brand Features; Attribution Brand Features. "Brand Features" is defined as the trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features of each party. Except where expressly stated, these terms do not grant either party any right, title, or interest in or to the other party's Brand Features. All use by you of Trimble's Brand Features (including any goodwill associated therewith) will inure to the benefit of Trimble. Attribution. You agree to display any attribution(s) required by Trimble as described in the documentation for the API. Trimble hereby grants to you a nontransferable, nonsublicenseable, nonexclusive license during the term to display Trimble's Brand Features for the purpose of promoting or advertising that you use the APIs. You must only use the Trimble Brand Features in accordance with these terms and for the purpose of fulfilling your obligations under this Section. In using Trimble's Brand Features, you must follow the Trimble Brand Features Use Guidelines (<a href="http://www.trimble.com/copyrights.aspx">http://www.trimble.com/copyrights.aspx</a>). You understand and agree that Trimble has the sole discretion to determine whether your attribution(s) and use of Trimble 's Brand Features are in accordance with the above requirements and guidelines. Publicity. You will not make any statement regarding your use of an API which suggests partnership with, sponsorship by or endorsement by Trimble without Trimble's prior written approval. Promotional and Marketing Use. In the course of promoting, marketing, or demonstrating the APIs you are using and the associated Trimble products, Trimble may produce and distribute incidental depictions, including screenshots, video, or other content from your API Client, and may use your company or product name. You grant us all necessary rights for the above purposes. </p>
<p>Section 7: Privacy and Copyright Protection Trimble Privacy Policies. By using our APIs, you agree that Trimble can use submitted information in accordance with our privacy policies, such as <a href="http://www.trimble.com/privacy.aspx">http://www.trimble.com/privacy.aspx</a> Trimble DMCA Policy. We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online, but we can't determine whether something is being used legally or not without their input. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. </p>
<p>Section 8: Termination Termination. You may stop using our APIs at any time. If you want to terminate these terms, you must provide Trimble with 7 days prior written notice and upon termination, cease your use of the applicable APIs. Trimble reserves the right to terminate these terms or discontinue the APIs or any portion or feature for any reason and at any time without liability or other obligation to you. Your Obligations Post-Termination. Upon any termination of these terms or discontinuation of your access to an API, you will immediately stop using the API, cease all use of the Trimble Brand Features, and delete any cached or stored content that was permitted by the cache header under Section 5. Trimble may independently communicate with any account owner whose account(s) are associated with your API Client and developer credentials to provide notice of the termination of your right to use an API. Surviving Provisions. When these terms come to an end, those terms that by their nature are intended to continue indefinitely will continue to apply, including but not limited to: Sections 8, 9, and 10. </p>
<p>Section 9: Liability for our APIs WARRANTIES. NEITHER TRIMBLE NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE APIS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON'T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE APIS OR THE CONTENT ACCESSED THROUGH THE APIS, THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. THE APIS AND CONTENT ACCESSED THROUGH THE APIS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS". SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF THE MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, TRIMBLE, AND TRIMBLE'S SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF TRIMBLE, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY WARRANTIES THAT MAY NOT LEGALLY BE EXCLUDED, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE APIS (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE APIS AGAIN) DURING THE SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY. NOTHING IN THESE TERMS LIMITS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. IN ALL CASES, TRIMBLE, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE. Indemnification. You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Trimble, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, and employees, or partners, from and against any third party claim arising from or in any way related to:</p><p> 1. your misuse or your end user's misuse of the APIs; or</p><p> 2. your violation or your end user's violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees, of every kind and nature. In such a case, Trimble will provide you with written notice of such claim, suit or action.</p>
<p>Section 10: General Provisions Modification. We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to an API occasionally, for example, to reflect changes to the law or changes to our APIs. We'll post notice of modifications to these terms or the additional terms within the documentation of each applicable API. Changes are effective seven (7) days after they are posted. However, changes specific to new functionality for an API or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. You agree that your continued use of the API constitutes an acceptance of the modified terms. General Legal Terms. These terms control the relationship between Trimble and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights. If you do not comply with these terms, and Trimble does not take action right away, this does not mean that Trimble is giving up any rights that it may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California's choice of law rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or related to these terms or the services. ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES WILL BE LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, USA, AND YOU AND TRIMBLE CONSENT TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN THOSE COURTS.</p>

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
<p>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</p>

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</p>
<p>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>

<p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

<p>12. CONFIDENTIALITY. Licensee shall protect the Licensed Materials and any information related thereto (collectively, "Confidential Information") by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination or publication of the Confidential Information as Licensee uses to protect its own confidential information of a like nature.

Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, all provisions survive except for Section 2.</p>
<p>14. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. Licensee shall adhere to all applicable U.S., European, and other export laws, including but not limited to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations ("EAR") (15 C.F.R Sections 730-774), and E.U. Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009. Further, pursuant to Section 740.6 of the EAR, Licensee hereby certifies that, except pursuant to a license granted by the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security or as otherwise permitted pursuant to a License Exception under the EAR, Licensee will not (1) export, re-export or release to a national of a country in Country Groups D:1, E:1 or E:2 any restricted technology, software, or source code it receives from AMD, or (2) export to Country Groups D:1, E:1 or E:2 the direct product of such technology or software, if such foreign produced direct product is subject to national security controls as identified on the Commerce Control List (currently found in Supplement 1 to Part 774 of EAR).

<p>17. GENERAL PROVISIONS. Licensee may not assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of AMD and any assignment without such consent will be null and void. The Parties do not intend that any agency or partnership relationship be created between them by this Agreement. Each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law. However, in the event that any provision of this Agreement becomes or is declared unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be deemed deleted and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>18. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties with respect to the Licensed Materials and supersedes and merges all prior oral and written agreements, discussions and understandings between them regarding the subject matter of this Agreement.
