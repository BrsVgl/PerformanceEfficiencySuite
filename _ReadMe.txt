===========
= Purpose =
===========
Most Reviewers solely focus on what they consider to be the most important aspect of modern CPUs - the absolute
performance.
But this is only one side of the equation. Today Power Efficiency is at least as important - or to be more precise:
The amount of energy (Wattseconds or Joules) a CPU needs in order to accomplish a given workload. Sadly most Reviewers
shy away from the extra mile it needs to assess this aspect.
This suite measures the Total Package Power of a CPU while running the CineBench R23 benchmarks first in single-threaded
mode, then running in multi-threaded mode (in a loop that has to last at least 10 minutes).
The results will be rendered in the provided "Results.xlsx" Excel file. 
To combine Efficiency and Performance there is also a score provided called "Performance Efficiency Score" (how 
amazingly inspired I am ;) ).

==========
= How-To =
==========
1. Unzip to wherever you want EXCEPT on your local OneDrive folder.
2. Open Settings.txt and insert your local Cinebench R23 & Geekbench 5 Directories.
3. Run "PES Start" - it will ask for Administrator rights as these are needed for measuring Package Power
4. Choose, which tests to run.
5. Wait until the Powershell finishes.
6. Open the Results Excel (recommended) or Results LibreOffice file...
    1. Allow external connections (to the generated CSV-files with the data)
    2. Enjoy and SHARE your results
7. If you want to do multiple measurements with different settings just copy the Excel file (inside the root-folder) 
    before running and refreshing the data.

= Some details about the Suite =
================================
- This Suite has been made possible by Michael MÃ¶ller and his amazing free and open-source Open Hardware Monitor and his
  .NET Library OpenHardwareMonitorLib.dll - Thanks a lot!!!
  Homepage: https://openhardwaremonitor.org/
  GitHub: https://github.com/openhardwaremonitor
- The results for the Package Power look pretty accurate compared to the sparse data the internet provides. Seems, that
  the vendors are much more honest with those sensors than they are with temperature etc.
- The suite basically consists of CB R23, some powershell scripts and an Excel file for presentation purposes
  - RunAsAdminWrapper.ps1 
    This is needed to have a convenient relative path shortcut in the root folder and request Admin rights at the same
    time
  - Main.ps1
    - After setting up some stuff it basically starts the Cinebench R23 one at a time. It then checks for the 
      "Cinebench.exe" process being active.
    - While this is true it queries the Package Power Sensor data with a lower bound of 10ms (in order to keep Processor
      load of the script at bay).
    - After each run the aquired data gets pushed to CSV files located in the LogCsv subfolder.
  - Results Excel.xslx
    The Excel file basically just does some import, calculations and a hopefully nice presentation of the data.
    - Histogram
      The bold line shows a running average of the last 100 data-points which should be sufficiently accurate.
      The pale line shows each single data-point.
    - Calculation of Total Package Consumption
      To get that number we need the integral. That is why we first calculate the timeframe between two data-points and 
      then multiply the measured value.
    - Everything else in that Excel is hopefully more or less self-explaining

= Disclaimer =

I am by no means a Powershell professional or a professional Reviewer. I was just sick of the lack of information and 
wanted to propose a low-effort solution. Any input for further improvement is highly welcomed. Please feel free to 
use/extend/rip-off this solution as you wish. But please share your findings to the world.

Yours Sincerelly,
